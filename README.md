 Currently, I am finalizing the HyperionDev Boot camp where I have learned Python foundamentals and I have gaind a basic understanding of SQL.
This has been an important journey to learn new concepts, compare ideas with others and reinforcing the logical thinking. 

I can write programs in Python able to get and modify and display data. For instance a financial calculator or a task manager application. Every putput can be customised depending on the needs.
